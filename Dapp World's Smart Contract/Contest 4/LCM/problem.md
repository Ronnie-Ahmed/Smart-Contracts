# LCM (Least Common Multiple) Smart Contract

LCM (Least Common Multiple) is the smallest multiple that two or more numbers have in common. In other words, it is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of the given numbers.

## Smart Contract Function

The smart contract contains the following public function:

### `function lcm(uint a, uint b) returns (uint)`

- This function takes two unsigned integers as inputs.
- It calculates and returns the LCM of the two input numbers as an unsigned integer.

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Function

lcm()

#### Parameter

8, 10

#### Returns

40

### Example 2

#### Function

lcm()

#### Parameter

12, 18

#### Returns

36

These examples demonstrate how the `lcm` function can be used to calculate the LCM of two numbers. In Example 1, the LCM of 8 and 10 is calculated as 40, while in Example 2, the LCM of 12 and 18 is calculated as 36.

Feel free to use this smart contract to calculate the LCM of any two unsigned integers.
